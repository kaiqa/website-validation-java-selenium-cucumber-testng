## This is demo bootstrap code with basic happy path test automation

## Features
* The test scenarious  should run successfully on **Chrome** as defined in the **config.properties** file.
* Support of different operation systems and browsers. The drivers are located at resources/drivers/.
* TestNG Annotations/hooks like "BeforeSuite", "AfterClass", "AfterMethod" etc.
* Upon test failure screenshots are created in the /screenshots directory.
* Reporting of test execution

## Scenarios
 * 2.1 Sign up the website using a valid email
 * 2.2 Log into the website
 * 2.3   Create first collection
 * 2.3.1 User should be logged in
 * 2.3.2 Press on Explore Rijksstudio (magnifying glass) on the top menu and
                  search for “Johannes Vermmer”
                  
 * 2.3.3 Press the heart icon displayed at the bottom of the “The Milkmaid” picture and
 add it to your first collection.
 *  2.4 Advanced search to look for a specific author
 * Verify pictures are displayed
 * Snapshot on a failed test.
 
## Improvements: 
* Random user generator for the registration and login with a library like java-faker. https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker
* Create additional classes for dialogs and forms.
* Shorten xpath locators or avoid completely
* Move functions from page classes to dedicated helper classes.
* Dry step definition and no hard coded logic 

## Random issues
* The advanced search form loses field entries on backend connection failure and does not recover.
* Test site unresponsive
